        <p>Magic Switch is a lo-fi chorus effect inspired by the classic analog ‘one-button’ chorus FX modules that were
            built into synthesizers back in the 80s. The plugin instantly delivers that washed out and slightly
            out-of-tune chorusing effect reminiscent of 80s synth music. (Scroll down to download the plugin)</p>

            for bringing dry synthesizers to life, but it sounds equally good on guitar, bass, and other instruments. In
            its default configuration OSL Chorus emulates the original unit, but adjustable parameters let you dial in
            custom choruses that range from subtle to extreme.</p>

        <img src="../img/plugins/effects/gate/renegate.png">
        <p>Renegate Free is a smooth noise gate plugin that is quick and easy to operate. The plugin utilizes
            program-dependent hysteresis to detect the unwanted noise and combines that with a look-ahead detection
            algorithm to preserve the transients. It also features a program-dependent auto-release to ensure a
            natural-sounding gating effect.</p>

        <img src="../img/plugins/effects/gate/a1-trigger-gate.png">
        <p>A1TriggerGate is a rhythmic trance gate used to modulate volume through the use of a sequencer. It can turn
            static sounds like pads and drones into exciting rhythmic sequences.</p>

        <h1>GGate</h1>
        <img src="../img/plugins/effects/gate/ggate.png">
        <p>GGate is a simple noise gate, useful when source material contains background noise during "silent" passages,
            such as the hum of an amplifier or artefacts from an effect chain. The main portion of the source audio is
            usually significantly louder than this background noise, so when GGate receives an appropriate boost in
            amplitude, it knows that it's time to let the signal pass through.</p>

        <p>Whether you want to crank the last drops of gain out of your track or just want to control a few loud peaks,
            a Limiter can be the weapon of choice. By looking a little bit into the future, the Snapin limiter can make
            sure your signal never goes louder than you want it to without distorting or destroying transients. Even
            with the knob turned to 11.</p>
